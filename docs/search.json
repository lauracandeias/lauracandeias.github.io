Currently, I work as a data analyst in the Research Department at the Fundação José Luiz Egydio Setúbal, focusing on studies of pro-social behavior. I am also a research assistant supported by the CNPq and contribute to projects in Brazilian electoral and legislative studies. Previously, I was a member of the Laboratory of Computational and Experimental Political Science.\nWhen I’m not working or studying, I enjoy diving into books (sci-fi is a favorite!) and trying to convince my friends to read them (not always a successful task). Feel free to reach out if you’d like to connect!"
