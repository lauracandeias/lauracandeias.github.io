Welcome!

I am an undergraduate Brazilian student in Political Science at the [Federal University of Pernambuco](https://www.ufpe.br/dcp). Currently, I work as a data analyst in the Research Department at the [Fundação José Luiz Egydio Setúbal](https://fundacaojles.org.br/departamento-de-pesquisa/), focusing on studies of pro-social behavior. I am also a research assistant supported by the CNPq and contribute to projects in Brazilian electoral and legislative studies. Previously, I was a member of the [Laboratory of Computational and Experimental Political Science](https://cpcex-lab.rbind.io/en/).

When I’m not working or studying, I enjoy diving into books (sci-fi is a favorite!) and trying to convince my friends to read them (not always a successful task). Feel free to reach out if you'd like to connect!
